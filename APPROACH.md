# Event Delegation Fix Approach

## Branch: `approach-event-delegation-fix`

## Problem
Event handlers are being accumulated across re-renders, causing multiple handler executions per event.

## This Approach
Focus on fixing the event delegation system to properly manage handler lifecycle.

### Strategy
1. **Improve handler removal**: Fix the `removeEventHandler` function to properly clean up old handlers
2. **Element-based handler tracking**: Use element references or IDs to track handlers more reliably
3. **Handler deduplication**: Prevent duplicate handlers from being added for the same element/event combination
4. **Event delegation optimization**: Optimize the event delegation system for better performance

### Key Areas to Investigate
- `addEventHandler` and `removeEventHandler` functions
- Event delegation map management
- Handler comparison and cleanup logic
- Element identification for handler tracking

### Expected Outcome
Event handlers should work correctly across re-renders without accumulation, while maintaining the event delegation architecture.

## Testing
Run the failing test:
```bash
CI=true npm test tests/dom-integration.test.ts -t "should handle event handlers correctly across re-renders"
```

## Current Status
- ✅ DOM updates working correctly
- ✅ Input value updates working
- ❌ Event handler accumulation issue remains
