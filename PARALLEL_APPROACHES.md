# Parallel Development Approaches

## Current Status
The main functionality is working correctly:
- ✅ Counter state updates work
- ✅ Todo list state updates work  
- ✅ Input value updates work
- ✅ DOM rendering and reconciliation work
- ❌ Event handler accumulation across re-renders (multiple handler executions)

## Git Worktrees Created

### 1. Event Delegation Fix (`/Users/zain/Code/GitHub/r17x/reactjs.scratch-event-delegation`)
- **Branch**: `approach-event-delegation-fix`
- **Strategy**: Fix the existing event delegation system
- **Focus**: Improve handler cleanup and lifecycle management
- **Approach**: Keep the event delegation architecture but fix handler accumulation

### 2. Direct Listeners (`/Users/zain/Code/GitHub/r17x/reactjs.scratch-direct-listeners`)
- **Branch**: `approach-direct-listeners`  
- **Strategy**: Replace event delegation with direct event listeners
- **Focus**: Simplify by using direct addEventListener/removeEventListener
- **Approach**: Remove event delegation complexity entirely

### 3. Main Directory (`/Users/zain/Code/GitHub/r17x/reactjs.scratch`)
- **Branch**: `master`
- **Status**: Current progress with partial fixes
- **Role**: Coordination and integration point

## Failing Test
Both approaches should focus on fixing this test:
```bash
CI=true npm test tests/dom-integration.test.ts -t "should handle event handlers correctly across re-renders"
```

**Expected**: Click count should increment by 1 per click
**Actual**: Click count increments by 2+ after re-renders (handler accumulation)

## Development Process
1. Each approach works independently in its worktree
2. Test fixes against the failing test case
3. Once a solution is found, merge back to master
4. Compare approaches for best solution

## Next Steps
Assign different Claude Code sub-agents to each worktree to work on their respective approaches in parallel.
